# Install tensorflow-macos/ tensorflow-metal

## System note
I am using Mac Book Pro 2019 Intel with AMD GPU and the macos is Monterey 12.1. Base on my experience, Anaconda python can cause crash when training my model. The best way to install is following Apple's guide to create a virtual environment without Anaconda.
